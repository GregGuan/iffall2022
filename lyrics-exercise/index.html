            Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich <br>
            Look at me 
            Fantasize about a white picket fence <br>
            With some trees 
            Used to want a pathfinder with some tints <br>
            Thats all I need 
            Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it wrenched <br>
            But now I see 
            That the worlds a lot bigger ever since <br>
            Picked up the paper and they say my Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced <br>
            Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits <br>
            Fuck being timid in the Civic 
            Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps <br>
            I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse? <br>
            Yeah can I get a glimpse?<br>
        </div> <br>

        Last night I had a bad dream <br>
        That I was trapped in this city <br>
        Then I asked is that really such a bad thing? <br>
        They robbin' on the daily <br>
        Keep on blamin' them that ain't never had things <br>
        Guess not, last night they pulled up at the light like <br>
        Uh, nice watch, run it <br>
        Hands in the air now, <br>
        hands in the air, run it <br>
        Hands in the air now, <br>
        hands in the air, run it <br>
        Hands in the air now, <br>
        hands in the air <br>
        Hands in the air now, <br>
        hands in the air<br>
        
        <br>

        Small town Hollywood dreams <br>
        I know that everything that glitters ain't gold <br>
        I know the shits not always good as it seems <br>
        But tell me till you get it <br>
        how could you know? <br>
        How could you know? <br>
        How could you know? <br>
        <br>



        <div class = "verse2">

        Listen up I'm about to go and get rich <br>
        Fuck with me 
        We gonna slug around the Ville and hit a lick <br>
        Cop some tree
        And some powder, bag it up and make it flip <br>
        You gon' see 
        One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick <br>
        And that's the key
        And listen up I'm bout to go and get rich <br>
        Stand back and watch if you want to  <br>
        Me I want my pockets fat about a bitch <br>
        Tired of seein' them flaunt, I wanna flaunt too  <br>
        Watch some rollers in the fuckin' Crown Vic <br>
        Tryna lock us up, that's what they won't do <br>
        Wanna know a funny thing about this shit? <br>
        Even if you let em' kill your dream it'll haunt you <br>
        </div>

        Last night I had a bad dream <br>
        That I was trapped in this city <br>
        Then I asked is that really such a bad thing? <br>
        I look around like do you want to be another  <br>
        That ain't never had things <br>
        Guess not, last night we pulled up at the light like <br>
        Uh, nice watch, run it <br>

        <p5> [Outro] </p5><br>
        Father forgive me for me, childish ways  <br>
        I look outside and all the clouds are gray  <br>
        I need your hands to take me, miles away  <br>
        Your wish is my command, my command, my command, but  <br>
        Before you go I've got to, want you now  <br>
        Whatever goes up surely, must come down  <br>
        And you get your piece but no peace, won't be found  <br>
        So why just take me man, take me man, take me man  <br>
        Your wish is my command, my command, my command  <br>

        <br><br><br>
