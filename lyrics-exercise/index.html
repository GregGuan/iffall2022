            Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
            Look at me 
            Fantasize about a white picket fence
            With some trees 
            Used to want a pathfinder with some tints
            Thats all I need 
            Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it wrenched
            But now I see 
            That the worlds a lot bigger ever since
            Picked up the paper and they say my Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
            Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limps
            Fuck being timid in the Civic
            Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
            I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
            Yeah can I get a glimpse?
        </div>

        Last night I had a bad dream
        That I was trapped in this city
        Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
        They robbin' on the daily
        Keep on blamin' them that ain't never had things
        Guess not, last night they pulled up at the light like
        Uh, nice watch, run it
        Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
        <br>

        Small town Hollywood dreams
        I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
        I know the shits not always good as it seems
        But tell me till you get it how could you know
        How could you know? How could you know?

        Listen up I'm about to go and get rich
        Fuck with me 
        We gonna slug around the Ville and hit a lick
        Cop some tree
        And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
        You gon' see 
        One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
        And that's the key
        And listen up I'm bout to go and get rich
        Stand back and watch if you want to 
        Me I want my pockets fat about a bitch
        Tired of seein' them flaunt, I wanna flaunt too 
        Watch some rollers in the fuckin' Crown Vic
        Tryna lock us up, that's what they won't do 
        Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
        Even if you let em' kill your dream it'll haunt you 
        </div>

        Last night I had a bad dream
        That I was trapped in this city
        Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
        I look around like do you want to be another 
        That ain't never had things
        Guess not, last night we pulled up at the light like
        Uh, nice watch, run it
        Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it

        Father forgive me for me, childish ways
        I look outside and all the clouds are gray
        I need your hands to take me, miles away
        Your wish is my command, my command, my command, but
        Before you go I've got to, want you now
        Whatever goes up surely, must come down
        And you get your piece but no peace, won't be found
        So why just take me man, take me man, take me man
        Your wish is my command, my command, my command
